x - distance from rotation axis [cm] (strictly positive)

y - distance above or below equator[cm]

velx - x velocity [cm/s]

vely - y velocity [cm/s]

velz - rotational velocity [cm/s] (to convert to angular velocity divide by the 
 lever arm, x, to get units of 1 / s

density - rest mass density [g/cm^3]
